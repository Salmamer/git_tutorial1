    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Advanced Data Visualization** class! In this notebook, we will build upon the basic plots we've already learned—line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and introduce more complex modifications and new types of charts. Effective data visualization is a crucial skill in data analytics, as it allows us to communicate insights and patterns in data clearly and efficiently. By mastering advanced visualization techniques, you'll be able to create more informative and compelling graphs that can help in data exploration and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also utilize data manipulation techniques like `groupby` and `merge` to prepare data for visualization. These techniques are essential for summarizing and combining datasets in ways that make them suitable for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create and customize advanced plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Use data manipulation techniques to prepare data for visualization.\n",
    "- Interpret advanced plots to extract meaningful insights.\n",
    "- Utilize subplots and layouts to compare multiple visualizations.\n",
